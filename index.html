                Hey there! My name is Ryan Harris and I am a current student in the Houston Coding Boot Camp offered by UT Austin.
                I'm learning all about frontend and backend development, as well as database management.
                <br><br>
                My interests in regards to coding, as they stand right now, is investingating the intersection between art and technology, as well as being UI/UX work.
                With my love for design, the user's experience and the actual client-facing side of development seems to be right up my alley!
                <br><br>
                I'm excited to learn everything that the boot camp has to teach me! Even though I know it's going to be difficult, I know that it will be worth it 
                Ever since I heard Donald Glover talk about his passion for coding, it ignited the same fire in me.
                <br><br>
                I also really want one of his "Learn to Code" sweatshirts, but they're now out of production. Know where to find one?
                I found one online but it was <strong>a lot</strong> of money.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, stay tuned for more content as I learn what the heck I'm doing.
